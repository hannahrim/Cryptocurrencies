# Cryptocurrencies
In this repository, I used unsupervised learning techniques to analyze data on the cryptocurrences traded on the market. This analysis is for one of my most important clients, Accountability Accounting. They are interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers. I used unsupervised learning to transform the data to fit the machine learning models. 
  First I prepared the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means. I then reduced the data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn in order to predict clusters using the cryptocurrency data via the K-means algorithm from sklearn. Lastly, I created a 3D scatter plot using Plotly Express to viusualize the clusters and a scatter plot to present my results.
